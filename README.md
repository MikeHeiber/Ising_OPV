Ising_OPV
=========

This software tool creates and analyzes bulk heterojunction morphologies for further use in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, such as the [Excimontec](https://github.com/MikeHeiber/Excimontec). 
This package implements an Ising-based model to quickly and efficiently generate three-dimensional bulk heterojunction morphologies on a cubic lattice in a parallel computing environment. 
In addition, morphologies derived from other simulations models or experimental measurements can be imported into the tool. 
Generated or imported morphologies are then rigorously analyzed to determine important morphological features such as the domain size, tortuosity, interfacial area to volume ratio, and more. 
If you would like some assistance in customizing this software tool for your particular research interest or application, please contact me to discuss collaboration options or feel free to contribute to the development of this open-source software tool.

#### Major Features:
- Create controlled binary phase separated blends with using tunable interaction energies and duration of phase separation
- Use smoothing to create idealized pure phase morphologies
- Impart controlled interfacial mixing between domains
- Create anisotropic morphologies using directionally dependent interaction energies
- Create morphology sets from imported experimental three-dimensional tomograms
- Calculate detailed structural analysis of the morphology set

## How to try Ising_OPV?

#### Building an Executable

This software tool uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) to utilize parallel computing power. 
As a result, using Ising_OPV requires that an MPI library is pre-installed on your system, and the final Ising_OPV executable must be built on your specific system. 
We cannot provide pre-built binaries for your system. 
Contact your HPC admin to determine the protocols for building MPI applications on your HPC system. 
In many cases, the HPC system will already be configured for you, and the package comes with a default makefile that can be used with the gcc compiler. 

If you wish, you can also install MPI on your own personal workstation and then build Excimontec there as well. For development and preliminary simulation tests, sometimes it is more efficient to run on your own workstation instead of an HPC system. More information about common MPI packages can be found here:

#### Usage
In most cases, your HPC system will use a job scheduler to manage the computing workload. 
For performing Ising_OPV simulations, it is recommended to submit batch jobs where you will request the resources needed to perform the simulation. 
An example batch script for the SLURM job scheduling system is provided with this package (slurm_script.sh). 
Similar batch scripts can also be written for TORQUE or other job schedulers.

Regardless of the job scheduler, the program execution command is essentially the same. 
For simple morphology generation jobs, Ising_OPV.exe takes one required input argument, which is the filename of the input parameter file. 
An example parameter file is provided with this package (parameters_default.txt).

For example, within the batch script, to create 10 morphologies using 10 processors, the command is:

>    mpiexec -n 10 Ising_OPV.exe parameters_default.txt

An optional second input argument is the path to an existing morphology file for importing a previously created morphology into the program for further modifications.

Users can also import morphology sets previously generated by the Ising_OPV tool for further modification and analysis.
To import an entire set of 10 morphologies in a parallel processing environment:

>    mpiexec -n 10 Ising_OPV.exe parameters_default.txt -import morphology_#.txt

This command will import 10 morphologies (morphology_0.txt, morphology_1.txt, etc) and assign one to each processor.
These morphology files must be located in the working directory to be found and imported into the simulation.

Finally, users can import experimental tomogram data, generate a morphology set from the data, and then perform further operations.


### Output
Ising_OPV will create several output files:
- analysis_summary.txt -- This text file will contain statistics about the set of morphologies that has been created.
- correlation_data_#.txt -- This text file will be created for each morphology when the correlation function calculation is enabled.
- correlation_data_avg.txt -- This text file will be created when the correlation function calculation is enabled and will contain the average correlation function from all morphologies in the set
- depth_dependent_data_#.txt -- This text file wll be created for each morphology when the depth dependent calculation is enabled and will contain depth dependent blend composition and domain size data for each site type in the lattice
- depth_dependent_data_avg.txt -- This text file wll be created for each morphology when the depth dependent calculation is enabled and will contain average depth dependent blend composition and domain size data for each site type in the lattice for the whole morphology set
-  end-to-end_path_data1.txt and end-to-end_path_data2.txt -- These text files will be created when tortuosity calculation is enabled and will contain the lengths of the shortest end-to-end paths through each domain type.
- interfacial_distance_histograms.txt -- This text file will be created when interfacial distance histogram calculation is enabled and will contain histogram data for each domain type.
- morphology_#_compressed.txt -- This text file will be created for each morphology generated in the est and stores the data for that morphology.
-  tortuostiy_histograms.txt -- This text file will be created when tortuosity calculation is enabled and contain the overall tortuosity histogram data for each domain type.
